> **What is Jobbr**?
> Jobbr is a .NET job server. It is designed to reduce artificial complexity when a job server is needed in a project.
> Jobbr tries to get out of your way as much as possible so that you can focus on business logic.
> Job implementations have no dependency to Jobbr which makes it easy to integrate Jobbr in any .NET project.
